# Threathunterspack

## About

Threat Hunters Pack is a plugin package for the Sublime Text Editor containing various utilities and templates useful in threat hunting scenarios. 

## Installation

Pr. now the installation process is as follows:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendefinition/Threathunterspack.git
```

2. Soft link the package into Sublime (your path may vary):

```
ln -s <full_path_>/Threathunterspack <full_path_to_home>/.config/sublime-text/Packages/
```

3. Right click in Sublime and check if menu entry "Threat hunters pack" is present. If not, there is probably something wrong with the soft link from step 2.
